# Scraping-XML-files-and-preprocessing-English-learners-data
I scraped some XML files for english interviews of an english exam called SST taken in japan, I used beautifulsoup

The first .py file is meant for preprocessing the data and the second is for the actual scraping

# Important notice 

The dataset is way too large so I only added a zip file, you can unzip it in the same folder and run the files in order
